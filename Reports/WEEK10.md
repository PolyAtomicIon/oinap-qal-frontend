This week I implemented the endpoints for the Developer's dashboard. In the Developer's studio (dashboard), the developer has the ability to view the games that he/she/it has uploaded to the platform, their status, such as how many people have played a particular game during its existence, feedback left by users, and the rating of the game at the moment. It is also possible to sort the games according to different criteria. It is possible to add a game and details about it, such as titles, descriptions, covers, genres and tags for games. It is also possible to edit and delete the game. We also changed the backend folder in the project to submodule into a separate repository.

Fixed errors that occurred after the transfer of the project; Moved changes to the new repository; Changed the Game entity by bringing a user with the developer role to it; Added property for counting the number of reviews; Changed property for calculating total_rate from sum to average; For GameSerializer added options and fields for users and feedbacks; Register new router for Developer's studio (dashboard); Added DevGamesViewSet for developer studio (dashboard) and rewritten all methods for CRUD; Added sorting by different options for developers on the developer's studio page; And fixed minor errors found when viewing the project;

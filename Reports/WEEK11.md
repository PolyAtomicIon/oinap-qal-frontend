This week I developed Admin's Page, where admin can accept, reject new games, and also can view game itself.

Developer's page:
![Admin page](./week11/admin.png)

Also refactored and fixed bugs in other components. 


## UX/UI Design
### Aimzhan Sytdykova

The arrows that you see in the screenshot are the user's flow, in other words, a prototype so that you can clearly see the user's path, it is possible to correct the shortcomings during its construction and testing. With it, I can test on the users themselves and see the ux problems and complement the design.

In the prototype, for example, there is a path where it shows how the player gets to the game page itself, or the developer enters the studio and downloads the game developed by him.

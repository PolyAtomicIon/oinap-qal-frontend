## UX/UI Design
### Aimzhan Sytdykova
In this week I worked with design of category, search and result pages and started creating mobile adaptive design versions of web pages.
With the help of a category, a person can choose a genre he likes and find a game suitable for it, or enter the name of the games into the search engine and find the right game.

* This week I researched about Ad Integration and was planning to integrate ads to our platform. First of all there were many technical questions regarding to API, integration and considering that we will work with tons of developers how should we make it easy to integrate ads etc.
* As a soultions for integration, as I wrote in previous week's report, we are developing our SDK for uploading games to platform, as others do.

* After finishing with APIs that helps to show Ad from our side and from developers side, whenever he decides it will be important, I started to register in AdSense and integrate Ads, and here is the list of problems:
1. The platform should be finished, all functions, buttons should work properly. Our backend and frontend still is in development.
2. Subdomains are not allowed, currently we have **oinap-qal.abmco.kz**, and our team is not ready to buy another host and set it up. 
3. Even if we will integrate Ads to our platform, Google do not easily allows to share revenue to third parties, in our case game developers. It requires some paperworks with lawyers and financial organizations. It will take our time and focus, that's why we discussed with our supervisor and decided to add only placeholder Ad for a while.

* Overall, this week's task is finished by plan, but because of AdSense rules I will postpone real Ad Integration for the future.

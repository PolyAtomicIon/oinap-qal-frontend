This week I made two necessary pages and their states in the web and mobile versions. This is the profile and settings.

In the mobile version, as well as in the web version, I decided to make an upper side menu to go to the profile and settings from the main page. Also in this menu there is an opportunity to log out of your account. In the mobile version of the profile, the user must go to the friends and rating tab to view the information he needs, and in the web version, this information can be seen immediately when entering his page. The mobile version was made so that there was no overload of information on one page. If we talk about the settings, then everything is simple there. A person can change their email or account password by clicking on "Edit".

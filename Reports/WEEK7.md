**Wireframes:**\
I started creating design from wireframes. It is speeds up the work because you think over the whole structure in advance. Also it is better for developers too.

**Main/home page:**\
How you can see I completed with design of homepage which is home page where users can to return by clicking on logo. Also I created components like header, categories, "cards" of games and so on. I will help me if I want to change something in one element everywhere at a time just by changing the obscene component.

**Registration/authorization page:**\
With these page I did the same things as in the previous one like elements or components. But this page has different states like reset password or inactive buttons until the user enters all the data correctly.

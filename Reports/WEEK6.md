# Aimzhan Sytdykova

It was done:

* Styles. Styles simplify the work of developers themselves when designing an application. They will be able to initially add styles to their code in order not to prescribe, for example, color codes and so on in the future. I made styles not only of colors, but also fonts, effect and grid.

* Design library. I added all possible icons to the design library that can be used in the application, and also created components that can be changed in one place and then changed on other pages too, this is done so that it does not take much time to edit each component on each page.

This week we set up django project and its configuration. We created separated dev branch for working on backend part, then configured working environment using poetry as a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python, installed all necessary dependecies( django rest framework, swagger ), configured it in django settings,  initiated and set up base modules such as Users, Authorization and Core.

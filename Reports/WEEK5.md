* Since I am responsible for UX/UI design in the project, I started with a resume and a mudboard, if you understand the area you are working on well and have an approximate vision, then the work process itself will be much easier.
Basically, I was looking at articles on user friendliness and how everything should look. For example, I found out:
Name and Nickname
People's names are their brands, so are their nicknames. Give users a chance to promote it. Not only should you introduce a 'nickname' field to this page, but you should also include the nickname in the URL. This way you will gain customers' loyalty and boost traffic to your site (especially if a famous person has an account on it). It's a good idea to allow adding both a name and a nickname. People often have the same username on multiple websites and apps, especially on those where a real name is not mandatory. Their friends who know just the nickname may search by it on your site or app to connect with the person.

* And also, I put together a mudboard. There are many interesting ones. With the help of them, I will clearly see what kind of Eton I want and be inspired by different design options.
